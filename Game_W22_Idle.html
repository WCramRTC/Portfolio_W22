    <h1>Winter 2022 - Idle Game</h1>
    <h3>Update: 1/9/22</h3>
    <p>Long night, but a basic foundation was setup. I have a general layout down. There were a few key things I made sure to read up and implement.</p>
    <p>CSS Grid Layouts: We've come a long way from messing with floats. I dove into Grid-Containers and Grid-Items. Implementing nested grids seems like it's going to be a very straight forward way of designing my gui. Whatever that ends up being.</p>
    <p>Aync Timer in JavaScript: I had a feeling that I was going to need to find a way to control the refresh rate of a loop, and that ends up being "requestAnimationFrame()". A newer version of the setInterval(), this gets executed prior to the screen being refreshed, so that guarentees everything stays insync. It's not necessary for this project, but it's a great upgrade. It was late so I tracked down someones approach to doing exactly what I need, running a loop at 10fps. Brilliant and succint, I posted the link down below.</p>
