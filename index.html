        <p>William Cram's Winter 2022 Portfolio</p>
        <p>About This Portfolio</p>
        <p>1/8/2022</p>
        <p>This is the start of the portfolio I'm making along with my students for the CSI-140 class. It's a kind of experiment. I rarely see teachers working alongside their students so I want to try something different. And I have a few idea's in mind for project pieces and feel this will light a fire under my bum to get them going and into the world.</p>
        <p>I'm limiting myself only to the what students have been taught at the time. They are encouraged to go all out and ahead, but I feel this will be a good showcase example of whats expected for the assignments, and maybe a little encouragement, inspiration, or something to laugh at depending how bad it is.</p>
        <p>Project - Game_W22</p>
        <p>I've enjoyed playing idle games for the past few years. Something soothing yet anxiety building about something that requires both no and so much at the same time. Idle games, like Cookie Clicker, Idle Heros, and Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realm. I thought it might be a good time to try to build one of my own.</p>
        <p>I plan to do this using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript also. No frame works, and doing nothing that couldn't easily be googled by my students so they can do some of the fancier things. Like cookies for persistent information. This should give me a chance to refresh and update my skills while also creating something novel.</p>
