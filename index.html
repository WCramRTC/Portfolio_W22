    About This Portfolio
    1/8/2022
    This is the start of the portfolio I'm making along with my students for the CSI-140 class. It's a kinda experiment. I rarely see teachers working alongside their students so I want to try something different. And I have a few idea's in mind for project pieces and feel this will light a fire under my bum to get them going and into the world.

    I'm limiting myself only to the what students have been taught at the time. They are encouraged to go all out and ahead, but I feel this will be a good showcase example of whats expected for the assignments, and maybe a little encouragement, inspiration, or something to laugh at depending how bad it is.
